malicious attacker
method: the skills, knowledge tools, other things with which to be able to pull off the attack
opportunity: the time and access to accomplish the attack
motive: a reason to want to perform this attack 

System security threats
- interception
- interruption
- modification
- fabrication

CIA
Confidentiality
Integrity
Availability

Vulnerbilities
- hardware, software, data

Principle of easiest penetration
principle of adequte protection -- computer items must be protected until they lose values

Salami attack -- performing small difficultly-detected malicious actions, resulting in great results for the attacker

Network, access, key people

Criminals
- amateurs - computer professionals who has access to something valuable
- cracker - high school, university students who seeks for access to unauthorized assets
- career criminals - those who understand the target of the computer crimes
- terrorists - target of attack, propaganda, method of attack


Method of defense
	- risk - the possibility of harm

prevent it - block the attack or close the vulnerbility
deter it - make the attack harder but not impossible
deflect it - make another target more attractive
detect it - as it happens or some time after the fact
recover from its effects

Controls - countermeasures

Software control
- internal program
- operating system and network
- independent 
- development

Hardware control
- encryption
- locks
- devices that verify  users' identities
- firewalls
- intrusion detection systems
- circuit boards that control access to storage media

Policies and Procedures

Physical controls
- locks

Awareness problem
- people need to know why security is needed

Principle of Effectiveness
- controls must be used properly to be effective; efficient, easy-to-use, and appropriate

principle of weakest link - security can be no stronger than its weakest link

flaw - fault or failure
vulnerbility - describes a class of flaws (i.e. buffer overflow)

Access control
- least privilege
- verify acceptable use
- check every access
