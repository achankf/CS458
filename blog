First file-encrypting ransomware found on Android

Recently, researchers have discovered possibly the first file-encrypting ransomware on Android, called the ``Simplocker".

Why is it important?
Since Android is a growing market, so, being fully-fucntional and is the first of its kind, it sets an example to other malware writers that ransomware is feasible on Android.

Who is affected?
Android users who use untrusted applications (i.e. apps that are not downloaded from Google Play) are particularly vulnerable to this type of attacks.
In order for the Simplocker to be effective, it must be installed manually by the user; so it is possible that victims fell into social engineering techniques and accidentally installed the ransomware.

What impact might it have?
Like many ransomeware, the victims either pay the ransom (260 Ukrainian Hryvnia, or $21), or they may lose their files.
In particular, the Simplocker mainly targets text, image, and video files; these files are encrypted with the AES cipher in a background thread.
In addition, Android/Simplocker sends data to remote a server via Tor, so sensitive private data may be leaked.

What were the causes?
One of the referenced article [2] points out that the Simplocker was originated from an application called ``Sex xionix," which is not a trusted app on Google Play.

How might similar problems be prevented in the future?
In order to avoid ransomware, the solutions are to backup important files, to avoid installing untrusted apps, and to be cautious about possible social engineering traps.

-------
Note that file-encrypting ransomware is a specific type of ransomware that use encryption to hold victims files as hostages.
The first Android ransomware, according to [4], was found in last month, which is a fake pornographic app that bricks Android phones and demands ransom, and threaten to report to the FBI for child pornography if the ransom is not being paid -- this is different from Simplocker in terms of the way in taking hostages.
